# Flood-Prediction-and-management-Tool
A flood detector android app based on artificial neural network algorithm.
Arduino based sensors sensing temperature,humidity,pressure and rainfall and providing output to android app via bluetooth 
Provding past statistics of flood at a particular region and employing artificial neural network algorithm via matlab ANN technology and predicting series of data
Incorporating matlab with android app and checking if the current sensor data matches with any of the predicted data series generated by matlab.
Employing messaging system that warns any possibility of flood within 6 hours.
